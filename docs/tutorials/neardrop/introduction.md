description: "Build a token distribution system that lets you airdrop NEAR, FTs, and NFTs to users without them needing gas fees or existing accounts."

Ever wanted to give tokens to someone who doesn't have a NEAR account? Or send an airdrop without recipients needing gas fees? That's exactly what we're building!

**NEAR Drop** lets you create token distributions that anyone can claim with just a private key - no NEAR account or gas fees required.

---

## What You'll Build

A complete token distribution system with:

- **NEAR Token Drops**: Send native NEAR to multiple people
- **FT Drops**: Distribute any NEP-141 token (like stablecoins) 
- **NFT Drops**: Give away unique NFTs
- **Gasless Claims**: Recipients don't pay any fees
- **Auto Account Creation**: New users get NEAR accounts automatically

---

## How It Works

1. **Create Drop**: You generate private keys and link them to tokens
2. **Share Keys**: Send private keys via links, QR codes, etc.
3. **Gasless Claims**: Recipients use keys to claim without gas fees
4. **Account Creation**: New users get NEAR accounts created automatically

The magic? **Function-call access keys** - NEAR's unique feature that enables gasless operations.

## Real Examples

- **Community Airdrop**: Give 5 NEAR to 100 community members
- **Event NFTs**: Distribute commemorative NFTs at conferences  
- **Onboarding**: Welcome new users with token gifts
- **Gaming Rewards**: Drop in-game items to players
