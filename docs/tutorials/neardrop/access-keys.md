This is where NEAR gets really cool. Function-call access keys are what make gasless claiming possible - let's understand how they work!

---

## The Problem NEAR Solves

Traditional blockchains have a chicken-and-egg problem:
- You need tokens to pay gas fees
- But you need gas to receive tokens
- New users are stuck!

NEAR's solution: **Function-call access keys** that let you call specific functions without owning the account.

---

## How Access Keys Work

NEAR has two types of keys:

**Full Access Keys** üîë
- Complete control over an account
- Can do anything: transfer tokens, deploy contracts, etc.
- Like having admin access

**Function-Call Keys** üé´  
- Limited permissions
- Can only call specific functions
- Like having a concert ticket - gets you in, but only to your seat

## NEAR Drop's Key Magic

Here's what happens when you create a drop:

   <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">
```rust
// 1. Generate public/private key pairs
let keypair = KeyPair::fromRandom('ed25519');

// 2. Add public key to contract with limited permissions
Promise::new(contract_account)
    .add_access_key(
        public_key,
        NearToken::from_millinear(5),  // 0.005 NEAR gas budget
        contract_account,               // Can only call this contract
        "claim_for,create_account_and_claim"  // Only these methods
    )

// 3. Give private key to recipient
// 4. Recipient signs transactions using the CONTRACT'S account (gasless!)
```
</TabItem>

**The result**: Recipients can claim tokens without having NEAR accounts or paying gas!

---

## Key Permissions Breakdown

Function-call keys in NEAR Drop have strict limits:

   <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">
```rust
pub struct AccessKeyPermission {
    allowance: NearToken::from_millinear(5),    // Gas budget: 0.005 NEAR
    receiver_id: "drop-contract.testnet",       // Can only call this contract
    method_names: ["claim_for", "create_account_and_claim"]  // Only these methods
}
```
</TabItem>

**What keys CAN do:**
- Call `claim_for` to claim to existing accounts
- Call `create_account_and_claim` to create new accounts
- Use up to 0.005 NEAR worth of gas

**What keys CANNOT do:**
- Transfer tokens from the contract
- Call any other functions
- Deploy contracts or change state maliciously
- Exceed their gas allowance

## Key Lifecycle

The lifecycle is simple and secure:

```
1. CREATE ‚Üí Add key with limited permissions
2. SHARE ‚Üí Give private key to recipient  
3. CLAIM ‚Üí Recipient uses key to claim tokens
4. CLEANUP ‚Üí Remove key after use (prevents reuse)
```

Here's the cleanup code:

   <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">
```rust
fn cleanup_after_claim(&mut self, public_key: &PublicKey) {
    // Remove mapping
    self.drop_id_by_key.remove(public_key);
    
    // Delete the access key
    Promise::new(env::current_account_id())
        .delete_key(public_key.clone());
        
    env::log_str("Key cleaned up after claim");
}
```
</TabItem>

---

## Advanced Key Patterns

### Time-Limited Keys

You can make keys that expire:

   <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">
```rust
pub struct TimeLimitedDrop {
    drop: Drop,
    expires_at: Timestamp,
}

impl Contract {
    pub fn cleanup_expired_keys(&mut self) {
        let now = env::block_timestamp();
        
        // Find and remove expired drops
        for (drop_id, drop) in self.time_limited_drops.iter() {
            if now > drop.expires_at {
                self.remove_all_keys_for_drop(drop_id);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

### Key Rotation

For extra security, you can rotate keys:

   <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">
```rust
impl Contract {
    pub fn rotate_drop_keys(&mut self, drop_id: u64, new_keys: Vec<PublicKey>) {
        // Remove old keys
        self.remove_old_keys(drop_id);
        
        // Add new keys
        for key in new_keys {
            self.add_claim_key(&key, drop_id);
        }
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

---

## Security Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use minimal gas allowances (0.005 NEAR is plenty)
- Remove keys immediately after use
- Validate key formats before adding
- Monitor key usage patterns

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Give keys excessive gas allowances
- Reuse keys for multiple drops
- Skip cleanup after claims
- Log private keys anywhere

---

## Gas Usage Monitoring

Track how much gas your keys use:

   <TabItem value="rust" label="ü¶Ä Rust">
```rust
impl Contract {
    pub fn track_key_usage(&mut self, operation: &str) {
        let gas_used = env::used_gas();
        
        // Log for monitoring
        env::log_str(&format!("{} used {} gas", operation, gas_used.0));
        
        // Could store in state for analytics
        self.gas_usage_stats.insert(operation, gas_used);
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

---

## Integration with Frontend

Your frontend can generate keys securely:

<TabItem value="js" label="üåê JavaScript">
```javascript
import { KeyPair } from 'near-api-js';

// Generate keys on the client
function generateDropKeys(count) {
    return Array.from({ length: count }, () => {
        const keyPair = KeyPair.fromRandom('ed25519');
        return {
            publicKey: keyPair.publicKey.toString(),
            privateKey: keyPair.secretKey,
            claimUrl: generateClaimUrl(keyPair.secretKey)
        };
    });
}

// Create claim URLs
function generateClaimUrl(privateKey) {
    return `${window.location.origin}/claim?key=${encodeURIComponent(privateKey)}`;
}
```
</TabItem>

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Access key not found"**
- Key wasn't added properly to the contract
- Key was already used and cleaned up
- Check the public key format

**"Method not allowed"**
- Trying to call a function not in the allowed methods list
- Our keys only allow `claim_for` and `create_account_and_claim`

**"Insufficient allowance"**
- Key ran out of gas budget
- Increase `FUNCTION_CALL_ALLOWANCE` if needed

**"Key already exists"**
- Trying to add a duplicate key
- Generate new unique keys for each drop

## Why This Matters

Function-call access keys are NEAR's superpower for user experience:

üéØ **No Onboarding Friction**: New users can interact immediately
‚ö° **Gasless Operations**: Recipients don't pay anything  
üîí **Still Secure**: Keys have minimal, specific permissions
üöÄ **Scalable**: Works for any number of recipients

This is what makes NEAR Drop possible - without function-call keys, you'd need a completely different (and much more complex) approach.

:::tip Key Insight
Function-call access keys are like giving someone a specific key to your house that only opens one room and only works once. It's secure, limited, and perfect for token distribution!
